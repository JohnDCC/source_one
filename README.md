# QuadRacer Honey Source (source_one)
Open Source FPV Drone Frame project initiated by Team BlackSheep, modified by QuadRacer. QuadRacer firmly believe that Open Source is a good thing and the design of the SOURCE ONE has some great features.  

# QuadRacer Changes
Changed Base Plate and Cross plate to:
- Be compatible with QuadRacer QuickChange Arms which meet at the centre
- Take Press Nuts at the outer most hole and also at the 20mm spacing
- Leave 30.5mm spacing without press nuts
- Extend additional 10mm at the front and back for longer batteries and less chance of props in view at lower angles

Changed Top Plate to:
- Have honeycomb central Pattern
- Increase length per the above
- Move battery strap holes etc accordingly

Altered camera plates to:
- Support 25mm height
- Both options in the drawings

QuadRacer arm designs have not been made available. In the interest of the spirit of the project, I have incorporated a modified SOURCE ONE arm that is compatible with this plate design.

# About SOURCE ONE
## The idea
The SOURCE ONE is the first of its kind, open source collaborative frame project. It empowers the community to integrate best practices and current trends into a continuously manufactured FPV frame. The price, documentation and compatibility puts it on track to be the most accessible frame for newcomers and professionals alike.

## Project naming requirements
SOURCE ONE is the name of the frame. If you are thinking about manufacturing it, you are expected to prefix the name with a brand name in order to allow customers to distinguish the different manufacturers, e.g. “TBS SOURCE ONE”. As a manufacturer you are also expected to denote the version number of the frame files that you have placed as basis of the project, e.g. “TBS SOURCE ONE V0.1”. 
If you have forked the project, you need to give it another name in order to avoid confusion between SOURCE ONE and your project.
Accessories from the SOURCE ONE project also need to be named with the entire prefix, e.g. “TBS SOURCE ONE FPV Camera Adapter”. Unless the file is not compatible with certain versions of the frame, the compatible version number or version range also needs to be included in the name, e.g. “TBS SOURCE ONE FPV Camera Adapter V0.1 - V2”
